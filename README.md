## 📌 What is Stress Testing?

Stress testing is an essential technique in software testing that helps you understand how a system behaves under extreme or unexpected conditions.  
With our stress testing tool, you can:
- Discover performance bottlenecks
- Identify memory leaks
- Determine scalability limits  
before releasing your application to production.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 Performance Testing Modes
- **Load Testing:** Simulate real-world user traffic to measure system behavior.
- **Stress Testing:** Exceed normal capacity to identify system breaking points and resilience.
- **Volume Testing:** Validate performance with large amounts of data.
- **Spike Testing:** Measure system response to sudden, extreme increases in traffic.

### 📊 Comprehensive Reporting
- Real-time dashboards with live metrics
- Detailed response time analysis
- Throughput and latency measurements
- Error rate tracking and reporting

---

## ✅ Why Use This Tool?

- **Easy Integration:** Test any web app, REST API, or microservice with minimal setup.
- **Highly Scalable:** Simulate from single users to thousands of concurrent connections.
- **Insightful Analytics:** Actionable reports to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.
- **Open Source:** Free to use, modify, and extend as needed.
